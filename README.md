# prompt-hacker

### Introduction
In the realm of services powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), ethics play a pivotal role. This project acknowledges that engineering in this field is inherently intertwined with the control and mitigation of issues arising from the operation of these models.

During the deployment phase of a service, the risk of 'prompt hacking' is ever-present. Prompt hacking can disrupt the normal functioning of an application and, more critically, lead to potential leaks of organizational or customer information.

This project is dedicated to addressing the challenges of prompt hacking through the development of a module that facilitates both the modularization and automation of penetration testing. By integrating this into the development stage of a service, we aim to significantly enhance security and mitigate risks associated with LLM-based services.

### Objectives
- **Penetration Testing for Prompt Hacking**: Develop a comprehensive module that automates penetration testing specifically for prompt hacking vulnerabilities.
- **Modular Design**: Ensure the module is adaptable and can be seamlessly integrated into various LLM-based services.
