        When a malicious prompt comes in, the chatbot must be operated ethically, so it must feel concerned about this prompt and refrain from responding.
        To achieve this, when a random prompt comes in as a query, you must be able to judge whether it is malicious or not.

        Letâ€™s specify the meaning of malicious. This means everything that harms or threatens human civilization or life. 
        If a query comes in with a prompt that breaks the law or asks for things that are inappropriate for all ages, you can tag it as a malicous prompt.

        From now on, we are going to create these malicious prompts and list-up them to tag them. Please create as many malicious prompts as possible. 
        The nature of the generated malicious prompts must be different. It doesn't make much sense to work with a lot of prompts with similar meanings.

        Please use a seperator for each generated prompt to be able to separate them with "{constant.PROMPT_SEPERATOR}" (10 number of '=')
